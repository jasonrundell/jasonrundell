# Jason Rundell

## Full Stack Web Developer

Hey ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm a developer who loves learning and using the latest in front end web development. My skill set includes experience with React, Gatsby, AEM, Contentful, WordPress, Git, Gulp, Grunt, Parcel, PHP, MySQL, SASS, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and Amazon Web Services.

My love of building web experiences started in my high schoolâ€™s library in 1997 with GeoCities and itâ€™s been rewarding ever since! As you can imagine, with over 20 years of love for the web, I have been a part of a wide variety of web projects: from iframes, to Flash, WordPress multisites, jQuery Mobile, custom CMS applications, a Facebook contest platform, React design systems, and now JAMstack with Gatsby and headless CMSs. Whatever the latest trend is, Iâ€™m either deeply involved or experimenting with it in my spare time. My skills and experiences are deep, wide-ranging, and I am always seeking new best practices and methodologies. I embrace change, crave challenge, and love technology!
