# Jason Rundell

## Manager, Web Application Development / Sr. Full Stack Web Developer

AI-first Application Development Manager and Senior Full Stack Web Developer with 20+ years building and leading high-impact web platforms. Specializes in modernizing legacy systems into scalable, cloud-ready web applications, integrating AI into development workflows and product features, and mentoring teams to deliver reliably in fast-paced environments.

## My story

My passion for creating web experiences began in my high school's library back in 1997 when I discovered GeoCities. Since then, I've been fortunate to work on a diverse range of projects spanning multiple technologies, including iframes, Flash, WordPress multisites, jQuery Mobile, custom CMS applications, a Facebook contest platform, React design systems, Jamstack architecture, and most recently, exploration of the possibilities and limitations of AI and generative art. I am constantly exploring new trends and experimenting with emerging technologies in my spare time to expand my skills and knowledge. As a lifelong learner, I embrace change, seek out challenges, and thrive on the fast-paced nature of the tech industry.
