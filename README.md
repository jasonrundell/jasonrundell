# Jason Rundell

## Full Stack Web Developer & Manager

Hey ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm a developer who loves learning and using the latest in front end web development. My skill set includes experience with Docker, React, NextJS, Gatsby, Contentful, PHP, MySQL, SASS, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and Amazon Web Services.

My passion for creating web experiences began in my high school's library back in 1997 when I discovered GeoCities. Since then, I've been fortunate to work on a diverse range of projects spanning multiple technologies, including iframes, Flash, WordPress multisites, jQuery Mobile, custom CMS applications, a Facebook contest platform, React design systems, Jamstack architecture, and most recently, exploration of the possibilities and limitations of AI and generative art. I am constantly exploring new trends and experimenting with emerging technologies in my spare time to expand my skills and knowledge. As a lifelong learner, I embrace change, seek out challenges, and thrive on the fast-paced nature of the tech industry.
